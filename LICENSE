BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

## 2. LICENSE GRANT

The Software is licensed, not sold. Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to install and use one copy of the Software on a single device owned or controlled by you.

## 3. RESTRICTIONS ON USE

You agree that you will not, and will not permit others to:

1.  **Reverse Engineering:** Decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt, or attempt to derive the source code of the Software (including the Rust/SolidJS logic and proprietary binaries).

3.  **Redistribution:** Rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the Software to any third party.
4.  **Security Bypassing:** Attempt to bypass, modify, or defeat the hardware-ID verification system, cryptographic payment verification, or any digital rights management implementation embedded in the Software.

## 4. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DISCLAIMER (READ CAREFULLY)

THE SOFTWARE UTILIZES GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS (Large Language Models, Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text) THAT OPERATE LOCALLY ON YOUR HARDWARE. BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:

1.  **NO CENSORSHIP / UNFILTERED CONTENT:** The AI models integrated into this Software are "uncensored." They do not contain corporate safety filters. The Software may generate text or audio that is offensive, disturbing, sexually explicit, factually incorrect, or legally restricted in your jurisdiction.
2.  **HALLUCINATIONS:** The AI may confidently generate false information ("hallucinations"). The Licensor makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy, reliability, or truthfulness of any output generated by the Software.
3.  **USER RESPONSIBILITY:** You assume full responsibility and liability for any content generated by the Software on your device. The Licensor is merely providing a tool; you are the operator. You agree not to use the generated output for any illegal purpose, including but not limited to defamation, fraud, or violation of local laws.
4.  **NO LIABILITY:** THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR CONTROVERSIES ARISING FROM THE CONTENT GENERATED BY THE AI MODELS.

## 5. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS

The Software aggregates and utilizes various third-party open-source components and model weights (including architectures based on Transformer and Flow Matching technologies).

1.  These components remain the property of their respective owners and are subject to their own licenses (such as Apache 2.0, MIT, or applicable Community Licenses).
2.  The use of these underlying open-source technologies does not grant the User any rights to the Licensor's proprietary interface, source code, or application logic.
3.  This Agreement governs the "Hetairos AI" application as a complete product.

## 6. PAYMENT AND HARDWARE ID

1.  **Final Transactions:** Licenses are purchased via cryptocurrency. Due to the nature of blockchain transactions, **ALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.**
2.  **Hardware Locking:** The license key is mathematically generated based on your specific machine's Hardware ID (HWID). If you change your motherboard or significant hardware components, the license may become invalid. The Licensor is under no obligation to reissue licenses for hardware changes, though support may be provided at Licensor's discretion.

## 7. OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. The structure, organization, and code of the Software are valuable trade secrets of the Licensor.

## 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE.

IN ANY CASE, THE LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.

## 9. TERMINATION

This Agreement is effective until terminated. Your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically without notice from the Licensor if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Upon termination, you shall cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Software.
